abstract = "Abstract Background: The assessment of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) requires large neuropsychological batteries that assess numerous domains. The relevance of these assessments to daily cognitive functioning is not well established. Cognitive ecological evaluation has not been frequently studied in MS. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the interest of cognitive evaluation in a virtual reality environment in a sample of persons with \{MS\} with cognitive deficits. Methods: Thirty persons with \{MS\} with at least moderate cognitive impairment were assessed with two ecological evaluations, an in-house developed task in a virtual reality environment (Urban DailyCog®) and a divided attention task in a driving simulator. Classical neuropsychological testing was also used. Results and conclusion: Fifty-two percent of the persons with \{MS\} failed the driving simulator task and 80% failed the Urban DailyCog®. Virtual reality assessments are promising in identifying cognitive impairment in MS. "
