abstract = "Abstract Background: The assessment of cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis (MS) requires large neuropsychological batteries that assess numerous domains. The relevance of these assessments to daily cognitive functioning is not well established. Cognitive ecological evaluation has not been frequently studied in MS. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the interest of cognitive evaluation in a virtual reality environment in a sample of persons with \{MS\} with cognitive deficits. Methods: Thirty persons with \{MS\} with at least moderate cognitive impairment were assessed with two ecological evaluations, an in-house developed task in a virtual reality environment (Urban DailyCog®) and a divided attention task in a driving simulator. Classical neuropsychological testing was also used. Results and conclusion: Fifty-two percent of the persons with \{MS\} failed the driving simulator task and 80% failed the Urban DailyCog®. Virtual reality assessments are promising in identifying cognitive impairment in MS. "

	abstract="Background: The objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of the da Vinci robotic system using both the three-dimensional view (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) view options with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic techniques in performing standardized exercises. Methods: To evaluate surgical efficiency in the use of robotically assisted and manual laparoscopic surgery for standardized exercises six, last-year medical students without any surgical experience were selected. The exercises consisted of placing rings over receptacles, grasping a free hanging suture and cutting three pieces of it, running a suture, and performing a surgical knot. Each student performed the exercise twice. The median times needed for completion of the exercises and the median number of errors in performing the tasks were noted. Results: The unexperienced students performed the standardized tasks significantly quicker and with fewer errors when assisted by the da Vinci robot in the 3D optical display mode, as compared with traditional manually assisted laparoscopic surgery. Even when the 2D mode was selected, a significant advantage favoring the da Vinci robotic system was seen both in time and efficacy for most exercises. When the 3D and 2D modes were compared, time differences in favor of the 3D mode remained, but a significant difference in efficacy favoring the 3D mode was seen only in one exercise (exercise 2: suture cutting). Conclusions: The da Vinci robotic system permits standardized minimal invasive surgical exercises to be performed quicker and more efficiently than traditional minimally invasive techniques. Therefore, with the aid of this robotic system, difficult laparoscopic interventions may become easier to perform, and indications for minimal invasive surgery may be expanded.",
