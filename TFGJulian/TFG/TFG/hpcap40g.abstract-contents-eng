{}{}  The fusion of the virtual reality with Robotic involves an opening to infinite possibilities. \par Both technologies are in continuous development, indeed virtual reality began to be known very recently, while their birth dates (year). \par In the last years virtual reality is making a place for itself in the current technologies. Perhaps the more commercial use that is being given is in relation to video games. However it is possible to apply to many others fields, in particular to the field of health, where virtual reality is getting really good results (in surgery, rehabilitation, etc). \par This work aims to explore the use of virtual reality and Robotic as a tool focused to people with motor disabilities, help them to be more independent and giving them the possibility of transport themselfs into real environments using virtual reality tools. \par For this purpose a system that consists on a \textbf {robot} and the \textbf {Oculus Rift} (glasses of reality virtual) has been built . The robot is controlled from the Oculus Rift, so while the user is wearing the glasses, the user can control the robot with head movements. The user will see through the glasses everything that the robot is seeing, so the robot acts like an extension of the user's view. \par Also the robot and the glasses are connected via wireless network , so the robot is free for move everywhere the user wants. This is essential for the objective that this work pursues. \par Along the development of the work several complications have emerged , the great most relating to the use the Oculus's sensors and to the library which is used for take information from the Oculus's sensors. \par This problems have been solving by the calibration of the servo-motor by experimental tests. \par Once the robot was built and the sowftware was implemented, differente users did some test for rating the usability of the project. The results of the first tests were not positive due to the control system which was implemented was not intuitive and it was very difficult for the user to control the robot. \par Based on the results of the first tests it was designed a new control system. This new system has shown much better results than the first tests . At the beginning of these second tests it was quite complicated for the users to control the movements of the robot, since they are not used to move based on the movements of the head. That is the reason why at the end of these tests ,servomotors speed was adjusted with the objective of making the robot slower. \par After all the changes were completed, a few final tests were made to other users. The results were very satisfactory since them reflected how in a few minutes the feeling of control of the users increases. Also it was easier for the users achieve the proposed goals. \par Despite the latest ratings positive, it is not recommended to use the glasses during much time without stop because the user can suffer dizziness. \par The final result of the work is a wireless device that the user can control only with the head. The devices allows the user to view himself environment through the Oculus Rift. Use Oculus Rift give the chance to see, not only the environment where the robot is , but a virtual environment created by the user. This part is left as subject of study for future work.
