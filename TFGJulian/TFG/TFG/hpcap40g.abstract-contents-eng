{}{}  The fusion between Virtual Reality and robotics brings a world of infinite possibilities. \par Both technologies are under continuous development. In fact, Virtual Reality has regained popularity very recently even though it was born during the nineteen sixties. \par In recent years we have witnessed how Virtual Reality finds a spot amongst our most used technologies. The most widespread commercial use comes from home entertainment, games concretely. Nevertheless it can be applied to many other different fields, like health, in which outstanding results are being obtained (in surgery, rehabilitation, etc...). \par This project attempts to explore the use of Virtual Reality and robotics as a tool focused on individuals who are disadvantaged with reduced mobility, to help them be more independent and bringing them the possibility of virtual immersion and transportation in real environments. \par To achieve this goal a system composed of a \textbf {robot} and the \textbf {Oculus Rift} glasses (Virtual Reality) has been built. The robot is controlled by the Oculus Rift glasses. A user wearing them will be able to control the robot's movements (transportation and exploration) with head movements. The user will see in real time through the glasses what the robot is seeing, making the robot an extension to the user's vision. \par Furthermore, we have designed the connexion model between the robot and the glasses to be made wirelessly, which gives the robot a wide movement freedom, helping the goal we seek to achieve. \par Once the robot was completely built and the software fully implemented, different usability tests were performed with several users. The first round of trials results weren't very positive as the control system was not very intuitive and the user had difficulties controlling the robot. \par Those first results led to the idea of a new control interface which, after implemented, resulted in better usability. It is clear how during the first attempts at controlling the robot the users were struggling to control the robots movements with precision, as they were not used to controlling movement just with their head's position. After this round of trials the robot's speed was adjusted to make it slightly slower. \par Once all changes were done, the final round of tests was performed with new test users. These results were very positive as users would quickly get accustomed to the robots sensitivity and movements after a few minutes, enabling them to reach the proposed targets much easier.\\ Even though the project is focused on people suffering from motor disabilities, it couldn't be tested with anyone with that condition. That's why it is important to have speed, range of movement, sensitivity, etc... as adjustable parameters in the system. This way when, during future work, it is tested with the users this project is targeted for it will be easy to calibrate and customize for that case's needs. \par Despite the positive reviews, it is not recommended to spend a lot of time using the system without taking the glasses off, specially if the user is not accustomed to them. In some cases it may cause dizziness and it has been questioned whether Virtual Reality Glasses may be damaging the users' retinas \cite {vreyes}. \par This project's final result is a wireless device that the user can control just by using their heads and which enables them to see the device's environment through Ouclus Rift. By using Oculus Rift we keep the possibility of seeing, not only the environment inside which the robot is moving, but a virtual environment created by the user himself. These questions have been left as study material for future work. \par \par \keywords [eng]{virtual reality, Oculus Rift, motor disabilities, robotics}
